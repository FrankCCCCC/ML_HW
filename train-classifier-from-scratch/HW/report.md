# Preprocessing Data
Use onehot encoding to preprocess the nominal feature of raw data such as doors and persons because of the features are nominal features. The features of raw data don't have intrinsic order. The features have limited class. It's easy to convert them to dummy numbers.

# Model Developing
Use SVM with RBF kernel trick. SVM has exellent capability to distinguish samples. RBF kernel trick can handle non-linear situation.

# Performance
## Accuracy:
### Task 1: 98.26%
### Task 2: 96%
